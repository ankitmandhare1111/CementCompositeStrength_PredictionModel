# Cement Composite Strength Predication Model

# Multivariate Analysis Project

# Problem Statement :
[Domain Knowledge]

# Objective

1. To Predict Cement Composite Strength Based on Independant Columns

# Steps to Build Machine Learning Model

## Step 1 :

Import Basix Scikit Learn Libraries for Data Manipulation as well Data Visualization.

## Step 2 :

Data Uploading Using Pandas Function

## Step 3  :
Doing Exporatory Data Analysis [EDA] :-->

1. Univariate Analysis

2. Bi Variate Analysis

## Step 4 :

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Also Feature Engineering**

## Step 5 :
1. Split Data into Independant and Dependant Column i.e X and y 

2. Using Train And Test Split into Prevent Data Leakage.


## Step 6 :

1. Model Building Using Scikit learn Libraries

## Step 7 :

Save Model Best Model As Pickle File

## Step 8 :
Deploy the Pickle File Using Streamlit
